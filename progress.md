## YYYY-MM-DD (Current Day - M1.8 Finalized Decoupled Arch & Strict Env Config)

*   **Task:** M1.8 - Decoupled Architecture, Executor Service, Security, Local Dev Env Setup, API Path Refinements, Strict Environment Variable Configuration
*   **Details:**
    *   Decided to decouple Docker execution into a separate Flask-based Executor Service.
    *   Created Executor Service in `backend/executor_service/` (`app.py`, `requirements.txt`, `Dockerfile`).
        *   Executor service endpoint set to `/internal/execute-script`.
    *   Image for executor: `prashantpatildev/pyexecute-executor:latest` (Flask-based).
    *   Refactored main FastAPI app (`backend/app/main.py`) to be an API Gateway:
        *   Endpoint set to `/api/execute`.
        *   Calls the Executor Service at `/internal/execute-script`.
    *   Implemented shared secret authentication between Gateway and Executor Service.
    *   Updated `backend/requirements.txt` for Gateway (added `httpx`, `python-dotenv`; removed `docker`).
    *   Added `python-dotenv` to Gateway (`backend/app/main.py`) to load a root `.env` file.
    *   Created root `.env.example` for Gateway's local development settings.
    *   **Hardened Environment Variable Usage:**
        *   FastAPI Gateway (`main.py`): `EXECUTOR_SERVICE_URL`, `GATEWAY_EXECUTOR_AUTH_TOKEN`, and `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` must now be explicitly set via environment variables (no fallbacks, even in development for CORS). Application will log critical errors or fail requests if these are not configured.
        *   Flask Executor (`executor_service/app.py`): `EXECUTOR_SHARED_SECRET` must be explicitly set (already implemented to fail if not).
    *   Local end-to-end flow is conceptually ready for testing with both services running and configured via `.env` files and explicit environment variables.
*   **Next Steps for User:**
    1.  Create/update root `.gitignore` to include `.env`.
    2.  Create `pyexecute/.env` from `.env.example` for the Gateway, ensuring all required variables are set.
    3.  Create `pyexecute/backend/executor_service/.env.local` (or similar for Docker run) for the Executor's `EXECUTOR_SHARED_SECRET`.
    4.  Rebuild and re-push `prashantpatildev/pyexecute-executor:latest` (Flask-based with auth and updated endpoint) if not already done after all latest changes.
    5.  Run both services locally to test integration with new paths, auth, and strict env var requirements.
    6.  Proceed with M1.8: Deployment of both services.
        *   Deploy Flask Executor Service, setting `EXECUTOR_SHARED_SECRET`.
        *   Deploy FastAPI API Gateway, setting `APP_ENV=production`, `EXECUTOR_SERVICE_URL`, `GATEWAY_EXECUTOR_AUTH_TOKEN`, and `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`.
    7.  Configure deployed Next.js frontend's `NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_API_URL` to point to the deployed FastAPI Gateway (base URL).
    8.  Thoroughly test the fully deployed application.
